## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML 5 Markup
- Sass
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned
I think this was a more of getting better at css than anything else. I think I am getting more grip on css which was always very frustrating to me. 



### Continued development
Mixins, conditionals, for loops in sass
